## LED layout

> Convert a 5x5 array into a 3x9 array to match the display's circuitry.

### Schematics

The [schem1] discussed earlier describe the electrical layout of the LEDs,
but they do not describe how it relates to the visual layout.
It would be a mistake to assume that the numbers 1 to 25 have any correlation
to the visual layout of the LEDs on the micro:bit as they do *NOT*.
It just happened to be that ROW0 and COL0 intersect at an LED in the top left corner.

### Reference design

To find the relationship between the electrical array and visual array, 
we need to look at the reference design for the micro:bit.
This can be found through a link at the bottom of the [micro:bit hardware page][hw]



By navigating to the github page > PDF > Schematic Print,
you can find a [detailed electrical schematic for the micro:bit][schem2].

In the top right, you will see an array which can be defined in Rust as follows:

``` rust
const LED_LAYOUT: [[(usize, usize); 5]; 5] = [
    [(0, 0), (1, 3), (0, 1), (1, 4), (0, 2)],
    [(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)],
    [(1, 1), (0, 8), (1, 2), (2, 8), (1, 0)],
    [(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3)],
    [(2, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (1, 5), (2, 1)],
];
```
