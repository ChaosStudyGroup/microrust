# Problem statement

> Display any given image on the micro:bit display.
> The image will be a 5x5 array, where 0 will represent off and 1 will represent on.

The following, for example, should display a heart:

``` rust
let heart = [
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
];
```

At this point, you may know enough to solve the problem yourself.
