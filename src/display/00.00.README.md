# WIP - LED display

This chapters follows on from the basic LED example from getting started.
The LEDs are wired up in a matrix, as described in [these schematics][schematics].
Only a small proportion of images can be displayed at once with this layout;
it is impossible for example to turn on both LED1 and LED11 without also having LED2 and LED10 turning on.

In this chapter we will be talking through how to achieve the impossible,
displaying any chosen image, and even adjusting the brightness!
