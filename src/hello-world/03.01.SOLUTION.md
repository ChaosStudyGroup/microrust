# Solution

This is my solution:

``` rust
{{#include src/main.rs}}
```

It is worth noting that pin4 starts low, so does not need to be explicitly set low.

You now know enough to start playing around with the micro:bit's LED display and GPIO,
as well as logging data back to the host.

You should know that the microbit crate already includes an abstraction for the LED display for you to use.
How to implemented a simple blocking display driver is demonstrated in the [LED display chapter](display/00.00.README.html).
