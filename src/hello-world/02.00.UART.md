# Serial communication

The micro:bit has a perihperal called UART,
a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter.
This is a form of serial communication, data is transferred serially,
i.e. one bit at a a time.
It is asynchronous communication, and there is no clock signal to dictate the bitrate,
intead this is agreed upon beforehand.
The protocol has frames consisting of a start bit, data bits, parity bits, and stop bits.
We will be using 8 bits per frame: 1 start, 6 data and 1 stop.
The data rate is called the _baud rate_, and we will use 115200bps.

## USB

The micro:bit allows us to transmit and receive this serial communication over USB with no additional hardware.

## Tooling

To read and write to the serial bus from your computer, you will need to configure your tooling:

- [*nix](../hello-world/02.01.NIX.html)
- [Windows](../hello-world/02.02.WINDOWS.html)

## Code

``` rust
use microbit::hal::prelude::*;
use microbit::hal::serial;
use microbit::hal::serial::BAUD115200;
// -- snip --
if let Some(p) = microbit::Peripherals::take() {
    let mut gpio = p.GPIO.split();
    // Configure RX and TX pins accordingly
    let tx = gpio.pin24.into_push_pull_output().downgrade();
    let rx = gpio.pin25.into_floating_input().downgrade();
    // Configure serial communication
    let (mut tx, _) = serial::Serial::uart0(p.UART0, tx, rx, BAUD115200).split();
    // Write string with newline and carriage return
    // This could also be a format string
    let _ = write!(tx, "serial test\n\r");
}
```

In minicom/PuTTY you should see:

```
serial test
```

This is a very simple introduction to using the UART as one way serial logging.
The chapter on UART serial communication goes into much more detail.
