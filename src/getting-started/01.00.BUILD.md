# New Project

``` console
$ cargo new rustled
     Created binary (application) `rustled` project
$ cd rustled
Cargo.toml  src
```

This has created a binary crate.

Now we could `$ cargo build` this, and even `$ cargo run` it,
but everything is being compiled for, and run on, your computer.

## Targets

The micro:bit has a different architecture than your computer,
so the first step will be to cross compile for the micro:bit's architecture.
If you were to do an internet search, you would find a [platform support list for Rust][platforms].
Looking into this page, you will find the micro:bit's nRF51822 Cortex-M0 microprocessor:

> `thumbv6m-none-eabi  [*]  [ ]  [ ]  Bare Cortex-M0, M0+, M1`

"thumbv6m-none-eabi" is known a a target triple. Note what the star represents:

> These are bare-metal microcontroller targets that only have access to the core library, not std.

To install this target:

``` console
$ rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
```

## Build 1

Now how should we use this? Well, if you were to take a look at `$ cargo build -h`, you would try:

``` console
$ cargo build --target thumbv6m-none-eabi
```

```
error[E0463]: can't find crate for `std`
  |
  = note: the `thumbv6m-none-eabi` target may not be installed

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0463`.
error: Could not compile `rustled`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
```

The help note is rather unhelpful because we just installed that target.
We also just noted that the thumbv6m-none-eabi target does not include std,
only the core crate, which is has a platform independent subset of the std features.
Why is it still looking for the std crate when we build?

### `no_std`

It turns out, rust will always look for the std crate unless explicitly disabled,
so we will add the no_std attribute

`src/main.rs`
``` rust
#![no_std]

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Build 2

``` console
$ cargo build --target thumbv6m-none-eabi
```

```
error: cannot find macro `println!` in this scope
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
4 |     println!("Hello, world!");
  |     ^^^^^^^
```

`println` is a macro found in the std crate.
We don't need it at the moment, so we can remove it and try to build again.

## Build 3

```
error: language item required, but not found: `panic_impl`
```

This error, is because the panic macro is unimplemented,
when rustc needs it to have an implementation.

### `panic_impl`

We could try and implement the panic macro ourselves,
but it's easier and more portable to use a crate that does it for us.

If we look on [crates.io for the panic-impl keyword][panic] we will find some examples.
Let us pic the simplest one, and add it to our Cargo.toml.
If you have forgotten how to do this, try looking at [the cargo book][cargo].

[platforms]: https://forge.rust-lang.org/platform-support.html
[panic]: https://crates.io/keywords/panic-impl
[cargo]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/

`Cargo.toml`
```
[dependencies]
panic-abort = "~0.2"
```

`src/main.rs`
```
#![no_std]

extern crate panic_abort;

fn main() {
}
```

## Build 4

``` console
$ cargo build --target thumbv6m-none-eabi
```

```
error: requires `start` lang_item
```

### `no_main`

In the normal command line rust binaries you would be used to making,
executing the binary usually has the operating system start by executing the C runtime library (crt0).
This in turn invokes the Rust runtime, as marked by the `start` language item,
which in turn invokes the main function.

Having enabled `no_std`, as we are targeting on a microcontroller,
neither the crt0 nor the rust runtime are available,
so even implementing `start` would not help us.
We need to replace the operating system entry point.

You could for example name a function after the default entry point, which for linux is `_main`,
and start that way. Note, you would also need to disable [name mangling][nm]:

```
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

[nm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling

This is the end of the road for trying to get this to work on our own.
At this point we need the help of a board specific crate and a few cargo tweaks to get this working.

## microbit crate

Let us add a dependency on the board crate for the micro:bit.

```
[dependencies]
panic-abort = "~0.2"
microbit="~0.5"
```

The microbit crate has 2 notable dependencies:

### `embedded-hal`

This crate is a HAL implementation crate, where HAL stands for *hardware abstraction layer*.
As rust becomes more and more popular in embedded development,
it is desireable to have as little hardware specific implementation as possible.

For this reason, the `embedded-hal` crate contains a range of hardware abstraction traits which can
be implemented by board specific crates.

### `cortex-m-rt`

This crate implements the minimal startup / runtime for Cortex-M microcontrollers.
Among other things this crate provides:
 - the `entry!` macro, to define the entry point of the program.
 - the `exception!` macro, to set or override a processor core exception handler.

This crate requires:
 - a definition of the specific microcontroller's memory layout as a memory.x file.
 - a definition of the hard fault handler
 - a definition of the default exception handler

For more detailed information,
you can use the helpful [cortex-m-quickstart crate][qs] and [its documentation][doc].

[qs]: https://docs.rs/crate/cortex-m-quickstart
[doc]: https://docs.rs/cortex-m-quickstart

## cargo config

Before we go any further,
we are going to tweak the cargo's configuration by editing `rustled/.cargo/config`.
For more information, you can read [the documentation here][cargoconfig].

[cargoconfig]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html

``` toml
# Configure builds for our target
[target.thumbv6m-none-eabi]
# Execute binary using gdb
runner = "arm-none-eabi-gdb"
# Tweak to the linking process required by the cortex-m-rt crate
rustflags = [
  "-C", "link-arg=-Tlink.x",
  "-C", "link-arg=-nostartfiles",
]

# Automatically select this target when running cargo for this project
[build]
target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"
```

### arm-none-eabi-gdb

This is a version of gdb (the GNU debugger) for the ARM EABI (embedded application binary interface).
It will allow us to debug the code running on our micro:bit, from your computer.

### Build target

Now, all you need to do is run `$ cargo build`,
and cargo will automatically add `--target thumbv6m-none-eabi`.

## Build 5

`Cargo.toml`
```
[dependencies]
panic-abort = "~0.2"
microbit="~0.5"
```

`src/main.rs`
```
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

extern crate panic_abort;

entry!(main);
fn main() {
}
```

``` console
cargo build
```

```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:9:1
  |
8 | entry!(main);
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected !, found ()
  |
  = note: expected type `fn() -> !`
             found type `fn() {main}`
  = note: this error originates in a macro outside of the current crate (in Nightly builds, run with -Z external-macro-backtrace for more info)
```

## `!` return type

A little known rust feature, so I will forgive you if you do not know what this means.
A return type of `!` means that the function cannot return
An easy way to implement this, is by using an infinite loop.

`src/main.rs`
```
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

extern crate panic_abort;

#[macro_use(entry)]
extern crate microbit;

entry!(main);
fn main() -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

## Build 6

```

A scary error, but if you look closely you will see `cannot open linker script file memory.x: No such file or directory`.
We mentioned something a little earlier about memory.x file.
To save you the hassle of scouring the internet for one or creating your own, you can copy it over into your project:

``` console
cp ../../memory.x ./
```

> Often a board support crate will already include this, so this step will not be necessary.

## Build 7

```
error: linking with `arm-none-eabi-gcc` failed: exit code: 1
  |
  = note: "arm-none-eabi-gcc" "-L" "/home/xxx/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/thumbv6m-none-eabi/lib" "/home/xxx/rust/rustled/target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/deps/rustled-e6053d34b0422141.2yhvr0tmp69gb94x.rcgu.o" "-o"

  = note: device.x:1: undefined symbol `DefaultHandler' referenced in expression
          collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

```

Notice `undefined symbol 'DefaultHandler' referenced in expression`.
We said earlier, as with the memory,
that the hard fault handler and default exception handler both need defining.

`Cargo.toml`
```
[dependencies]
panic-abort = "~0.2"
cortex-m-rt="~0.5"
microbit="~0.5"
```

`src/main.rs`
```
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

extern crate panic_abort;
extern crate cortex_m_rt as rt;

#[macro_use(entry, exception)]
extern crate microbit;

use rt::ExceptionFrame;

exception!(HardFault, hard_fault);

fn hard_fault(ef: &ExceptionFrame) -> ! {
    panic!("{:#?}", ef);
}

exception!(*, default_handler);

fn default_handler(irqn: i16) {
    panic!("Unhandled exception (IRQn = {})", irqn);
}

entry!(main);
fn main() -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

It is all a bit ugly, but fortunately it only needs to be done once.
If you try building now, you should finally be greeted with `Finished`!

## Build Complete

As a sanity check, let's verify that the produced executable is actually an ARM binary:

``` console
$ file target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/rustled
target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/rustled: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped
                                                                    ^^^  ^^^^
```
