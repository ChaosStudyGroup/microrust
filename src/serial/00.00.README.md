# WIP - UART serial server

In the first section of this book we saw how to do a simple debug print using serial.
This is useful for logging and debugging, but does not cover the full potential of the UART peripheral.

## Input and output

The simultaneous input and output capabilities of the UART allow for both your computer and the micro:bit to act as a server.
They can receive a transmission, process it, perform some action, and send a response.
