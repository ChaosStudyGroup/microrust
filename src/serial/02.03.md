# Quiz

Let us create a simple quiz system.
The quiz will have a quizmaster and 2 contestants;
the quizmaster will operate the host computer,
and the micro:bit's user buttons will be used as buzzers for the 2 contestants.
We have only learnt about blocking operations so far,
so the following cannot be done at the same time:

+ Scan the buttons for presses
+ Operate the LED display
+ Operate the serial UART

For the sake of consistency, let us say that the quiz should have 11 questions.

## Flow

1. Display question number and score.
2. Wait for a contestant to press a button.
3. Print the constestant who buzzed in to the quizmaster's computer.
4. (optional) Display the contestant who buzzed in to the contestants on the micro:bit for 1-2 seconds.
5. Prompt the quizmaster for whether the contestant answered correctly.
6. Record the updated score and repeat from 1, unless someone has won.
