# Display

The micro:bit display is not trivial to control, so a driver is needed;
see [the display chapter](../display/00.00.README.html) for more details.

Display calls for now are only blocking, and can either be for binary images (0 for off, 1 for on),
or for monochrome images with differing brightness levels

## Blocking binary image display

``` rust
{{#include examples/display_blocking.rs}}
```
