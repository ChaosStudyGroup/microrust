# Choose your own adventure

At this point of the book,
you know the basics to get you started with embedded development with Rust.

The following chapters are all independent of each other.
This means they can be done in any order,
and the only required knowledge is found in the chapters before this.
You can either follow the rest of the boo in order, or choose a chapter based on:
what sounds the most interesting, or contains the information to solve a problem.
